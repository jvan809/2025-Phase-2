# 2025 Phase 2 - Data Science
Welcome to Phase 2 of the 2025 MSA Data Science stream. This phase is divided into three 3 parts:

1. [Analysis and Preprocessing](1.%20Analysis%20and%20Preprocessing)
2. [Machine Learning Project](2.%20Machine%20Learning%20Project)
3. [Deep Learning Project](3.%20Deep%20Learning%20Project)

You will complete all three parts and submit them as a **single GitHub repository**.

For help, refer to inline notebook instructions or the `README.md` files within subfolders.


---

## Part 1 – Data Analysis and Preprocessing (20%)

- **Objective**: Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand a dataset and prepare it for downstream machine learning tasks.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `part1_submission.ipynb`
  - A summary (using a Markdown cell in each notebook you create, `.txt`, `.pdf`, or in another readable format)
---

## Part 2 – Machine Learning Project (20%)

- **Objective**: Build a model to predict **`MinTemp`** using a real-world weather dataset.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `part2_submission.ipynb`

---

## Part 3 – Deep Learning Project (60%)

- **Objective**: Classify test images into 10 categories using a ResNet18 model trained via knowledge distillation from a ResNet34 teacher.

- **Deliverables**:
    - `part3.ipynb`
    - `submission.csv`: Final test predictions (Kaggle-style format)
    - `IEEE_Report.pdf` or `.docx`: Your final technical report in **IEEE format**

---

## Submission Instructions

- Submit a **single GitHub repository link** containing all three parts, organized in subfolders as shown below.
- **MAKE SURE THE REPO IS PUBLIC**.
- Ensure all notebooks are executable and contain visible outputs.
- The report (Part 3) must follow IEEE formatting guidelines.
- Label all files clearly and keep your folder structure clean and consistent.
- Your final submission must be a single repository containing the following structure:
   ```
